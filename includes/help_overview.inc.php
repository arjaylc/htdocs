		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
		<ol style="padding-left:15px; margin:0 0 0 5px;">
		<li>
			<i>Where does the data come from?</i><br/>
			- The data we use for generating these summary reports comes from the surveys and evaluation forms answered by the students and company supervisors. <br> <br>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>When a student leaves the group, does this summary get affected?</i><br/>
			- Yes. This is why we highly encourage users to stay in their original groups, unless of course, if there is an absolute need to transfer to another one.<br> <br>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Are there any different display settings for the summary reports?</i><br/>
			- No, but we are currently working on it. A better and more convenient practicum overview is on its way!
